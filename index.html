  <h2>
    Hello there! I'm Jason
  </h2>
  <p>
    I'm a software engineer living in Brookline, MA and working at
    <a target="blank" href="https://www.hubspot.com/">HubSpot</a>.
    Most of my free time is spent with my wonderful wife Michelle and ornery yet adorable cat Rory.

  <p>
    Also in my free time, I love to rail against terrible companies like Comcast and tacky movies like Project Almanac.
