        Hello there! I'm Jason
      </h2>
      <p>
        I'm a software engineer living in Brookline, MA and working at
        <a target="blank" href="https://www.hubspot.com/">HubSpot</a>.
        Most of my free time is spent with my wonderful wife Michelle and ornery yet adorable cat Rory.

        Also in my free time, I love to rail against terrible companies like Comcast and tacky movies like Project Almanac.
